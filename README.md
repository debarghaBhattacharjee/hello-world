Hello!

I’m a reagular student with an interest in building efficient and user-friendly apps. Also want to learn a bit of game development.
I am a over of art and design- one of the reason why I am obssesed with creating efficient user-interfaces.
When I’m not busy programming, you can find me playing the guitar, painting, reading a novel or maybe just watching a movie(BTW, I am a great movie buff)..
Want to work together? I’d love to hear from you.
